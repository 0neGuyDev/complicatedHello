# About

What the fuck is this? You may ask.
Good fucking question, this project/repository is just me messing around while I can't sleep.

I have actually been thinking of doing something like this for a long time, but I finally managed to get my shit together and do it, not that it really helps anybody or that it has any good reason to exist, I simply made it.
This project is what I would usually call a sleeper project, which in my book means a project at which I made while I couldn't sleep or while being sleep deprived *(Sleep is for the weak)*
In other terms, I made this without a clear state of mind yet still thought it was a good idea to go through with.

# What is?

Can't you fucking read, the title is literally **"complicatedHello"**, the description is also pretty fucking descriptive, I mean apparently you can read, why the fuck else are you able to read this but not the title.
Well let me just explain it like your stupid, this project is meant to be the most stupid and complicated way to spell "Hello World!"
So in other words you can fuck off because you won't get anything good use out of this, outside of just wasting your time.

No I mean it fuck off, there is no purpose in being here, you won't get anything, there's no reward, there's nothing, just "Hello World!" but very complicated.
So if you're expecting anything, **stop**, leave and don't come back, **I mean it** I should've made that clear by now

# Why this exist?

Sleep deprivation

# Purpose
None whatsoever.
